# BruteForce

### In this project we decided to run a little experiment to find out how much time it takes to break different kinds of passwords using brute force. Brute forcing refers to a specific way of trying to break a password. The algorithm is very primitive: it simply tries all possible combinations until it finds the correct one. The time required for a brute force algorithm to crack a password goes up exponentially with the length of the password and the number of possible characters used in the password.

### We have an SQL database with some user names and passwords, and an authentication service that works with the user data. The SQL database used in this project is provided by SQLite, a fast, lightweight and self-contained database solution written in C. SQLite is a serverless database, with all data stored in a single database file, making it very easy to set it up and get started.
### We use the GUI application DB Browser for SQLite to inspect and manage our SQLite databases.

### We are going to learn:
### •	Use SQLite database.
### •	Connect to SQLite database from C#.
### •	Run SQL queries from C# against SQLite.
### •	Work with ASCII table.
### •	Use System.Diagnostics.StopWatch to measure time.
### •	Understand repository pattern.
